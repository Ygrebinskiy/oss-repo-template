# Why is it important to choose a license?

  If you intend to create free software, it is necessary to release it under a free software license. Otherwise, the intent is not clear, and many will be wary to use your project in fear of copyright strikes.
  
# Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

  A project without an explicit license is an ambiguous project. It has a better chance of being a private or copyrighted project compared to one with an explicit license. As such, contributing or using such a project can cause problems for yourself rather than solely being a benefit to those involved. 

# Do you agree with the claims of how Web beat Gopher?

  There are many reasons that Christopher Lee provides as to why the Web beat Gopher, and I agree on the whole. 

# Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).
